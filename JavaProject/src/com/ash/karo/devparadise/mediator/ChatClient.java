	 * Mediator Design Pattern Important Points 
	 * 
	 * Mediator pattern is useful when the
	 * communication logic between objects is complex, we can have a central point
	 * of communication that takes care of communication logic. 
	 * 
	 * Java Message Service (JMS) uses Mediator pattern along with Observer pattern to allow applications
	 * to subscribe and publish data to other applications. 
	 * 
	 * We should not use mediator pattern just to achieve lose-coupling because if the number of
	 * mediators will grow, then it will become hard to maintain them.
